> Cypress bundles with Chai, Chai-jQuery, and Sinon-Chai libraries.
> Cypress also bundles a few of its own assertion methods, some of whose names overlap with the bundled assertions.
> Cypress implicitly retries for availability of elements for the default timeout before erroring.
  [There is also the ability to wait for a desired condition using lighter syntax, unlike in Selenium
 where fluent waits and their conditions, interval e.t.c need to be specified with verbose code.]

 E.g Wait for slide 3 element to have specific class - Cypress
    cy.get("jump to slide 2", {timeout:60000}).should('have.class', <<classname>>)

Chai
====
> Generic assertions. Can be BDD style - expect() or should() or TDD style assert.<<condition>>()

Chai-jQuery
===========
> Used to assert on properties of a DOM element such as visibility, prop, attr. Used often with element-yielding commands
 like cy.get(), cy.filter(), cy.contains()

Sinon-Chai
===========
> Used to assert on functions returned by cy.stub() and cy.spy()
